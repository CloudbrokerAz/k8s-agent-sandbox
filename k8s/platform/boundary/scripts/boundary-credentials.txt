  Configuration IDs
==========================================

Organization:       o_pgKEGRAoAq (Agent Sandbox)
Project:            p_SHJoifnVWu (Development Environment)
Target (TCP):       ttcp_k61NqMmPSK (VSCode Remote SSH compatible)
Target (SSH):       tssh_bu1SpYV1Zi (Credential injection - not for VSCode)

==========================================
  Usage (VSCode Remote SSH)
==========================================

1. Authenticate with Boundary via Keycloak:
   export BOUNDARY_ADDR=https://boundary.local
   export BOUNDARY_TLS_INSECURE=true
   boundary authenticate oidc -auth-method-id=amoidc_Us9rH7Nwaa

2. Create a TCP tunnel (keep this running):
   boundary connect -target-id=ttcp_k61NqMmPSK -listen-port=2222

3. VSCode Remote SSH Configuration:
   Add to ~/.ssh/config:

   Host devenv-boundary
     HostName localhost
     Port 2222
     User node
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     StrictHostKeyChecking no
     UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null

4. Connect via VSCode:
   - Open VSCode
   - Use Remote-SSH: Connect to Host
   - Select "devenv-boundary"

Note: Your SSH key must be authorized on the target host.
      Use the TCP target (ttcp_k61NqMmPSK) for VSCode Remote SSH.
      The SSH target with credential injection won't work with VSCode.
